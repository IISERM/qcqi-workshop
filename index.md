# Motivation

Phi@I is thrilled to announce our upcoming workshop on Quantum Computing and Quantum Information on 18th and 19th February, 2023. The workshop will be a gentle introduction to the enigmatic topics of quantum computation and quantum information.

The workshop will be conducted over two days, with each day split into two, two-hour sessions. Each session will include a 45-minute talk, followed by discussions and a 10-minute break, during which tea and snacks will be provided. See the full schedule [here](./schedule)

The workshop will aim to explain the basics of quantum computing and quantum information in an easy-to-understand manner, so even if you have no prior experience in the field, you will be able to follow along. However, a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and linear algebra will be helpful.

# Goals

The main goal of the workshop is to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the field, and leave you with a lot of food for thought. Here are some of the key takeaways from the workshop:

- Introduction to computation, classical and quantum
- Physics and Computation
- Ideas in Quantum algorithms
- Introduction to Quantum information
- Entanglement, correlations, and resources
- "Current" research

Apart from the exploratory overview of the field, we will also share further reading materials for you to read up on.
